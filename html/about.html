        <h1>The interface</h1>

        <p>This is an experimental proofreading interface that I will, after a great deal more
        testing, be integrating into DP as a third control option. It can be considered to be
        licenced under the GPLv3 â€” I'll release the source code as soon as this preliminary test is
        done.</p>

        <p>The interface uses some more recent web technologies, so you will need a recent
        browser. It is regularly tested under Firefox and Chrome. Any recent version (last year or
        so) should work fine. It is also occasionally tested in IE 8 and Safari. Older versions of
        IE will probably not work.</p>

        <p>The control is not currently hooked up to the DP servers, so there is no danger of
        damaging the main site.</p>

        <p>The control is designed to be used mainly with the keyboard but also has a simple
        mouse/touch interface. See <a href="controls.html">proofreader controls</a> for details. I
        haven't tested on tablets yet because I don't own one, but it should work (please let me
        know if it doesn't!).</p>

        <h1>The test</h1>

        <p>This test consists of 10 pages of "Sophy of Kravonia". It uses a roundless system;
        everyone does P1 and I will merge the results to get a final version. I will release a page
        detailing all the diffs once I have sufficient data. Please make a note of your user number
        (actually your IP address) which is displayed in the top right of the page list if you want
        to check your work.</p>

        <p>Please proofread according to the DP <a
        href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php"> proofreading guidelines</a>.</p>


        <h1>Features</h1>

        <p>So far, the following features have been implemented:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Synchronised scrolling and highlighting. A "current line" is highlighted in the image
          and the text to help your eye scan easily between the two versions. If the line
          synchronisation is lost (this usually occurs as a result of clothing hyphens) they can be
          re-synchronised by moving the highlight in the image pane only.</li>

          <li>Resizability. Using the handle in the bottom left hand corner of the control, you can
          set the size. As you change the width, the image zooms in and out.</li>

          <li>Continuous validation. Every time you close the editor after making a change, the text
          is sent to the server to be checked. So far, all punctuation is highlighted green, digits
          are underlined green, spelling errors are underlined amber and end of line hyphens and
          incorrect punctuation are underlined red. The final version should also underline in green
          any word that is a member of a stealth scanno pair, but, since I don't yet have a list of
          these, for the moment you just get "he" and "be".</li>

          <li>Context pages. The previous and next page images are available by scrolling the image
          window beyond the limits of the current page. Ultimately, this could make it simple to
          move hyphenated words up from the next page, thereby saving the PPers a job.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Tips</h1>

        <p>I have found that the interface works best with multiple passes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pass 1: Looking at the top pane, move the highlight to the first line of each
          paragraph and check on the bottom pane that there is a blank line above it.</li>

          <li>Pass 2: Check and if necessary correct all underlined items.</li>

          <li>Pass 3: Compare each line, paying particular attention to the highlighted
          punctuation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After each pass, you can press "h" to return to the top line.</p>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
