        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <p>This is a proof of concept proofreading interface. It is not hooked up to the DP servers,
        so there are only 10 pages available; they are served in random order. You cannot do any
        damage, but you also cannot save your work.</p>

        <p>It is designed to be used mainly with the keyboard. The controls are:</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Key</th><th>Action</th></tr>
          <tr><th>j</th><td>Move both highlights down one line.</td></tr>
          <tr><th>k</th><td>Move both highlights up one line.</td></tr>
          <tr><th>shift + j</th><td>Move the image highlight down one line.</td></tr>
          <tr><th>shift + k</th><td>Move the image highlight up one line.</td></tr>
          <tr><th>e or i</th><td>Edit the text.</td></tr>
          <tr><th>ESC</th><td>Close the editor and re-validate.</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>So far, the following features have been implemented:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Synchronised scrolling and highlighting. A "current line" is highlighted in the image
          and the text to help your eye scan easily between the two versions. If the lines become
          un-synchronised, use the shifted versions of the movement keys to re-synchronise.</li>

          <li>Resizability. Using the handle in the bottom left hand corner of the control, you can
          set the size. As you change the width, the image zooms in and out.</li>

          <li>Continuous validation. Every time you close the editor after making a change, the text
          is sent to the server to be checked. So far, all punctuation is highlighted green,
          spelling errors are underlined amber and end of line hyphens are underlined red. The final
          version should also underline in green any word that is a member of a stealth scanno pair,
          but, since I don't yet have a list of these, for the moment you just get "he" and "be".</li>

          <li>Context pages. The previous and next page images are available by scrolling the image
          window beyond the limits of the current page. Ultimately, this could make it simple to
          move hyphenated words up from the next page, thereby saving the PPers a job.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
